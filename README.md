The way the data entry form would work is that you would enter medical address, its post code, telephone number. 
You then would save the form which then keeps the records stored safe. 
You can also edit an existing medical centre record and then update the new record and save it. 
There is a sub-form which also lets you add and edit a GPs detail. 

### Form 2

This form is called MDI which stands for multiple document interface. This form allows the users to access other forms, for example you would click Reporting and that would open the report form. 

### Form 3

This is a child form which lets you add, edit, delete, and select a medical centre which is displayed on the list. After selecting one of the medical centres from the list, it would then open up form 1 which allows you to edit or add a medical centre. 

### Form 4

This is Form lets you view the Consultants Appointment Dates Report Which is R1. This is also a child form. I have added a report viewer on a report. I also have added a refresh button and date selectors.
